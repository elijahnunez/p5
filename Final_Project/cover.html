  <h1>Pedro Pietri</h1>
  <p>Pedro Pietri (1944–2004) was a Puerto Rican poet, playwright, and revolutionary voice of the Nuyorican literary movement. Known for his radical style, surreal wit, and fierce commitment to the lived experiences of Puerto Ricans in the U.S., Pietri fused poetry with protest, performance with politics. He was a founding member of the Nuyorican Poets Café and the author of Puerto Rican Obituary, a landmark poem that captured the disillusionment and dignity of working-class Boricuas in New York.

    Loose Joints is an experimental collection that blends fragmented verses, stream-of-consciousness riffs, and street-level philosophy. Each "joint" smolders with humor, resistance, and vulnerability—echoing Pietri’s belief that poetry should disrupt, unsettle, and liberate.
    
    This project is a tribute to his visionary work: a digital smoking area where poems light up, drift, and linger—just like Pietri’s voice in the minds of those still listening.</p>
