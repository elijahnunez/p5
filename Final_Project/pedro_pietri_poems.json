      "content": "We went to where the mountains\nstay real high indefinitely,\nour feet touched the earth\nand the sky every step we took,\nthe clouds outside our thoughts\ngave a slow motion ovation\nto the mystery of the vision\nwhose shadow is inspiration\nfor the climate of flowers\nwhose hours of daylight & darkness\nare into the highest thousands,\nWe fell asleep sp on the grass\nthat illuminated our feelings\nand introduced us to a world\nwhere everybody owns a spaceship\nand has been to many planets to keep up with the latest dance,\nwhen we woke up later on\nit was the same exact time\nwe had fallen asleep earlier,\nthe wind started undressing\nit looked very colorful naked,\nWe took a bath with smokе\nfrom flames inside glass mirrors,\nWe laughed as loud as we could\nas memories of the future\nConvinced us to feel unreal\nwhen it rained we got wet\nand started a long conversation\nabout magic until the sun came out\nat night to keep us daydreaming\ncompliments, to decorate the lyrics of the experience that allows you\nto drown many times and live\nto start an endless romance\nwith who turns you on the most"
